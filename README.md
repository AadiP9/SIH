CivicVoice
A mobile-first platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and local government, empowering communities to report and resolve civic issues efficiently.

The Problem
Local governments often face challenges in promptly identifying, prioritizing, and resolving everyday civic issues like potholes, malfunctioning streetlights, or overflowing trash bins. While citizens encounter these issues daily, a lack of effective reporting and tracking mechanisms limits municipal responsiveness. CivicVoice aims to solve this by creating a direct and transparent communication channel.

‚ú® Key Features
CivicVoice is built with two primary users in mind: the community members who report issues and the municipal staff who resolve them.

üë• For Citizens
Effortless Reporting: Quickly submit a new issue using a photo, automatic GPS location tagging, and a short description via text or voice note.

Real-Time Tracking: Track the status of your submitted reports through every stage‚Äîfrom "Reported" to "Acknowledged" and finally "Resolved."

Push Notifications: Receive instant notifications on your mobile device as your report's status is updated.

Community Upvoting: View nearby reports and upvote them to help authorities identify and prioritize the most critical issues.

üè¢ For Municipal Staff (Admin Portal)
Centralized Dashboard: A web-based administrative portal with a live, interactive map displaying all reported issues across the city.

Automated Routing Engine: Incoming reports are automatically categorized and routed to the correct department (e.g., Public Works, Sanitation) based on their category and location.

Powerful Task Management: View, filter, and sort reports by category, location, status, or priority. Assign tasks to teams and update resolution status.

Data-Driven Analytics: Access insightful reports and analytics on issue trends, departmental response times, and overall system effectiveness to improve accountability and resource allocation.
